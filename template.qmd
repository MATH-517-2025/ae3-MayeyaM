## Theoretical exercise

Your answer goes here

## Practical exercise

Unless stated otherwise, your answer to the practical part should include the following elements:

-   Description of the aim of the simulation study.
-   Description of the different quantities that intervene in your simulation study. Explain how these quantities (fixed or random) are defined and the reasoning behind the choices you made.
-   Description of your findings using appropriate graphics and/or tables (with a caption!) that are well commented in the text.

The code should not appear in the PDF report, unless there is a specific reason to include it.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Your code goes here. 
# The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
# The programming language can be changed to Python or Julia

```

**Structure and details:**

[Aim of the simulation study:]{.underline}

The goal is to observe the impact of various parameters on the estimation of the IMSE-optimal bandwith $h_{IMSE}, \sigma^2$ and $\theta_22$. In particular how it varies with respect to

-   various values (combinations) of the $\operatorname{Beta}$ function, $\alpha,\beta>0$ (see below)

-   various values (combinations) of sample size $n$ and block size / number of blocks $N$ (see below)

[Fixed quantities:]{.underline}

-   $\alpha,\beta>0$ are the parameters of the $\operatorname{Beta}$ distribution, they're are usually named `alpha` and `beta` in the code. We have a sample size $n$ and a number of blocks $N$, they're usually denoted descriptively, for example `sample_size` or `size` and `number_of_blocks`. Note that in the README, we consider the size of the blocks instead of the number \[???????????????????? what do i do s??????????????????????????\]

-   ADD IF NECESSARY

[Code architecture:]{.underline}

Technical functions are located in a file `functions.py` with usual alias `fct`. There, we have the following functions:

-   `generate_sample` takes input `alpha, beta, n_samples, sigma_2` which respectively represent $\alpha$, $\beta$, the number of samples $n$ and the variance of the error $\epsilon$, $\sigma^2$.

-   `estimate_parameters` ADD

-   `estimate_sigma_theta` ADD

-   `est_h_IMSE` takes input `sigma_2_hat, theta_22, size` as inputs which respectively represent $\hat\sigma^2$, $\hat\theta_{22}$ and the sample size $n$. It returns $h_{IMSE}$ as given in the README.

-   `simulate` ADD

The plotting functions are accessible through a file called `plot_results.py`. There, one can use any of the functions below:

-   `plot_simple_fit` ADD

-   `plot_alpha_beta_impact` ADD

-   `plot_sample_blocks_impact` ADD

[Additional quantities:]{.underline}

-   `covariate, response` ADD

-   THE RETURN FUNCTION

[How to simply plot results:]{.underline}

To call them, use the console with one of the following keywords `key`$\in\{$ `simple_plot, alpha_beta_impact,sample_blocks_impact` $\}$ and call as follows: `py plot_results.py key parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 ...`

where `parameter1 parameter2 ...` are the functions parameters in order as mentioned above.
